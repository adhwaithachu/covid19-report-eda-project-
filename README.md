## 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a global **COVID-19 dataset** to understand the spread, trends, and impact of the pandemic across countries and regions.  
It involves analyzing confirmed cases, recoveries, deaths, and other key metrics to uncover insights using Python and data visualization tools.

# Objectives

- Analyze worldwide COVID-19 spread and trends

- Identify top affected countries and regions

- Study correlation between confirmed, deaths, and recovered cases

- Visualize how the pandemic evolved over time

- Highlight recovery and mortality patterns

# Tools & Libraries Used

- Python

- Pandas – Data cleaning, transformation, and analysis

- Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization

- Jupyter Notebook / VS Code – Interactive analysis environment

# Key Insights

- The number of confirmed cases increased exponentially during early 2020.

- Recovery rates improved over time as medical response strengthened.

- Death rates varied widely by country and healthcare infrastructure.

- Some regions experienced multiple waves of infection.

- Strong positive correlation between confirmed and recovered cases.

# Conclusion

The COVID-19 dataset reveals crucial information about the global impact of the pandemic, spread dynamics, and response patterns.
EDA helps visualize how COVID-19 evolved and highlights the differences in regional impacts and outcomes.
